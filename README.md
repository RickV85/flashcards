# FlashCards by Rick Vermeil

### `Abstract:`
This is a trivia game for coders interested in JavaScript where a user interacts with in the game in the terminal, picking a guess from three multiple choices to each of 30 different questions. The user is provided feedback on whether their answer was correct or not after each question. Once the game concludes, the user is provided with feedback that the game is over and the amount of questions they answered correctly.

### `Installation Instructions:`
1. [Click To Open Repo](https://github.com/RickV85/flashcards)
2. Click the "Fork" button. (This will create a user copy of the repository.)
3. Open the Terminal application.
4. In Terminal, use the "cd" command to navigate to where the local repository will live.
5. In GitHub, click on the green "Code" dropdown.
6. User will see three clone options. Select "SSH".
7. Copy the SSH key.
8. In Terminal, run "git clone [insert copied SSH key here]".
9. In Terminal, use the "cd" command to navigate into the newly created directory.
10. Open the local repository by typing:
    * Atom - atom .
    * VS Code - code .

### `Context:`
This was our first solo Project assigned in Mod 2 of Turing's Front-End Program and it's primary objective was implementing a robust testing suite and ES6 class methods.  We only had three days to complete the project so the UI was required to be very basic.

### `Learning Goals:`
 - Contribute code to an partially constructed object-oriented application
 - Follow spec/prompts to make a working application
 - Implement ES6 classes
 - Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
 - Implement a robust testing suite using TDD

### `Technology Used:`
JavaScript for this application was written in VS Code and pushed into GitHub. 

### `Wins`
I learned a lot about Mocha and Chai's role in writing JavaScript that is resilient to changes and how to write good tests in proper syntax. Up until now, we have not written any tests to validate our code, but have worked with many test files.

### `Future Additions`
Obviously, this app is not user friendly, not even to a coder so I would liek to improve the UI. Creating a web application with HTML and CSS would make this game much more enjoyable for the user. I think the ability to add new trivia questions in would be great as well.
